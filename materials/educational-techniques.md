# Edu-Eth Educational Techniques
This document describes the techniques used in the educational Ethereum app. Please add the relevant issue when referencing additions in your PRs.

## Pomodoro
The pomodoro technique constrains learning to 25 minute intervals.
Implementing this as a timer in the app will be possible.
Additionally, giving users the option to set the timer length with a default of 25 minutes should increase effectiveness.
The technique has been shown to be effective as a learning method. ([source](https://facilethings.com/blog/en/science-behind-pomodoro-technique))
