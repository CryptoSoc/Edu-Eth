### Without Installing Android Studio

Git is version control software that allows many people to contribute to projects at the same time. It can be a little intimidating if it's your first time so here's a super friendly tutorial. It gets a bit lengthy so if you do need a little help, grab a comsci student and get the basic commands explained.

Download Git

From a terminal type

`git clone https://github.com/CryptoSoc/Edu-Eth`

This downloads the files locally to your computer. You can now edit the files that you want to contribute to.
